I"<p>This week we were introduced to this project, as well as bootstrap and frameworks.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is essneitally someting that allows you to have a starting point to then branch off and add to whatever it is you are working on. A bootstrapper can be used in many different aspects, including lauching programs, or providing a template for your code to then be updated at a later time.</p>

<p>Jekyll, which is the bootstrap method we are using for this project, is an open source framework that allows us to host webpages</p>
