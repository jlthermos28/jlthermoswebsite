This week focused more on workflow, HTML, CSS, and mentioning of JavaScript. This week introduced things like gitbash and shells. 

The main focus of week 2's videos were workflow, and how to best use your IDE to maximize your productivity. The main takeaway from those videos is to essentially use your own IDE but to make sure that it has decent integration with git, so that your code can easily be uploaded to and from GitHub. The other major takeaway form this week is understanding version control, in that it is very important to know when and where to push your final code, in order to accurately update an exisiting project.

This week was the springboard into the future weeks in terms of coding and other various jobs that a programmer will need.
