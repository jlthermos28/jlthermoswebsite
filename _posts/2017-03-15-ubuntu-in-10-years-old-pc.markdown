During lesson 1 we learned about Git and GitHub. There were two instructional videos on how to use GitHub.

The main part of this lesson was to understand Git and how to use it in conjuction with GitHub. The majority of the lesson included pushing, creating pull requests, forking, and other basic Github functions. 

A syllabus review was also a part of the lesson, as it was the first week of class, which is also means it is syllabus week. 

There wasn't much else to this week, be it the intriductory week.
