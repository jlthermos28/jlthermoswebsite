This week we were introduced to this project, as well as bootstrap and frameworks. 

Bootstrap is essneitally someting that allows you to have a starting point to then branch off and add to whatever it is you are working on. A bootstrapper can be used in many different aspects, including lauching programs, or providing a template for your code to then be updated at a later time. 

Jekyll, which is the bootstrap method we are using for this project, is an open source framework that allows us to host webpages and create dynamic and static web pages.
